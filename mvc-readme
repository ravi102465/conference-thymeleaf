download start.spring.io with web dependency
static web pages should be uploaded in war format
so change packing type in pom file

<packaging>war</packaging>
Add dependency of tomacat

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

static pages in war are server fro src/main/webapp
create webapp folder in src/main/
traditional jsp pages are server from src/main/webapp/WEB-INF
create new folder jsp inside WEB-INF

extend main class  ConferenceApplication extends SpringBootServletInitializer

change application properties
    spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/jsp/
    spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp
    This can be done manually by impelenting WebMvcConfigurer and creating custom view resolver for more details see ConferenceConfig.java class
    

Internationalization(I18N):
    grabing them from resource bundle this can be done by using interceptors
    
Interceptors:
Intercept call to servers and perform special task on call.
common example : logging, security, I18N, performance monitoring
check I18N example for more details
